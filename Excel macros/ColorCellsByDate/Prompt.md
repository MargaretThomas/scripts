I need a VBA macro for Excel that colors cells in column B based on the dates in column A. Each unique date should be assigned a different color. The macro should use a `Collection` to manage the dates and their corresponding colors.

Here are the details:

-   **Column A** contains the dates.
-   **Column B** contains related activities.
-   Each unique date should have a unique color.
-   The color index should be managed such that the index is reset if it exceeds 56.

Please provide the VBA code for this macro and ensure that it works for both Windows and Mac versions of Excel.
